*\(^.^)/* WELCOME TO POSHCAR *\(^.^)/*
A collection of Python scripts designed to make your work with VASP ~47.973% less painful.

Hi. Welcome to the changelog. Here I document any new changes made since April Fool's Day 2020.

<April 2, 2020>
I named this suite SHMOSCAR. With any luck, more people will appreciate and use this very lightweight package over time.
I am numbering version numbers by date, with format YY.MM.DD.
The extant scripts are: AtomSub, AtomSub1 (deprecated), Coords, ElemSwitch, and Seldyn
You can try them out with the notebook file: functions-demo.ipynb
A POSCAR file (POSCAR-2310.vasp) has been harvested from the wild for your experimentations.

<April 21, 2020>
The entire thing gets a streamline: heavily-used global variables and functions are moved to Shmoscar.py
Compcar.py is still work in progress. It will be used to calculate drift that happens during relaxation

<December 4, 2020>
Modified AtomSub.py to enable vacancies (I can't believe that is not already implemented!)

<November 9, 2023>
Big updates which I forgot to mention on the changelog! More modules were added in 2022 to build cells
Demo notebooks are being written

<November 30, 2023>
Added Smiles.py to make unit cells containing an organic molecule
Demo notebooks are maintained; looking for ways to display unit cells interactively
