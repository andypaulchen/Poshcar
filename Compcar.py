# Compcar: Compare POSCAR, before and after relaxation

# Are you curious to find out how much atoms move before and after the relaxation step? This routine
# converts the direct coordinates to cartesian and then calculate the movement vector. I imagine you can
# plot the results by MATLAB and see which atoms move the furthest.

# Day #29 of lockdown. The archery target has arrived and I have been shooting some arrows. The punchbag
# loan from Krav Maga Warrensville has also come to great use. I go to Huaxin (North Randall) every
# Wednesday for groceries. The ladyboss laughs at me, and thinks I go there too often. "Have you eaten
# everything already?" she asks. We had snow twice last week, which turned spring into winter briefly.
# I went out and saw Bambi eating fresh spring leaves by Doan Brook, but don't worry, I didn't shoot him.
# The big shale rock face at Frankie's Gate is always wet. I am wondering if this is what people call
# spring water.
